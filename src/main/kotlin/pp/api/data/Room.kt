/**
 * A planning poker room.

 * Each room has an id and at least one user (because empty rooms are discarded). The Room class is immutable, so any
 * action taken on a room will result in the creation of a new room object with adjusted properties. One could argue
 * that this class should have been a data class, but we want to make sure, [equals] (and [hashCode]) only look at the
 * rooms' id.
 *
 * @property roomId id of this room. There is no restriction on what [String] can be a room id. But since this id is
 *  used in equality tests, there can be only one room with a given id
 * @property users list of the [User]s in this room
 * @property deck list of the card values available in this room
 * @property gamePhase [GamePhase] this room is currently in
 * @property log list of [LogEntry]s for this room
 * @property version
