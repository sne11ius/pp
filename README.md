# pp - Planning Poker Server

üéâ Welcome to **pp**! üéâ

## What is pp?

**pp** (Planning Poker) is server application that provides a (mostly
websockets) API to play planning poker. If you don't know what planning poker
is, you might want to read up
[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_poker).

## Clients

If you want to play planning poker using this server, you will need a client.
There are two awesome alternatives right now:

- [ja-ko/ppoker](https://github.com/ja-ko/ppoker) is an opinionated TUI
  (terminal user interface) application, relying heavily on keyboard shortcuts.
  You should totally check it out.
- [pp-client.el](https://github.com/hennes-maertins/pp-client.el) allows you to
  play planning poker inside the best of all operating system: emacs. You should
  totally check it out.

Historically, there was a an "official" client, written in
[golang](https://go.dev/). It was discontinued due the other alternatives being
superior. You can still check out the source from the last commit before removal
at this [hash](https://github.com/sne11ius/pp/commit/f77bbb677e1b2a35d426337769ff18ba9440d49e).

## Running pp

pp is distributed as docker image. A simple

```shell
    docker run ghcr.io/sne11ius/pp-api:latest
```

should get you going after downloading the 40MB image. You can look up specific
versions of pp in the [github container registry](https://github.com/sne11ius/pp/pkgs/container/pp-api).

## Configuration

pp cannot be configured and has no runtime dependencies (eg. no database). pp
runs on port `8080`.

## Development

pp is written in [kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) and
[quarkus](https://quarkus.io/).

We use [gradle](https://gradle.org/), [graalvm](https://www.graalvm.org/) and
[upx](https://upx.github.io/) to produce a docker image that only clocks in at
around 40MB.

### Running in development mode

You can run the application in dev mode that enables live reload using:

```shell script
./gradlew quarkusDev
```

> **NOTE:**  Quarkus ships with a Dev UI, which is available in dev mode only
> at [localhost](http://localhost:8080/q/dev/).

### Release

To build a releasable docker image, run the following command. This may take
quite some time, but the resulting image should be small (about 40MB).

*Important*: This command must be run in the root of this repo, since the build
needs the `.git` directory to extract the git hash of the current commit.

```shell
docker build -f src/main/docker/Dockerfile.distroless -t pp/api .
```
